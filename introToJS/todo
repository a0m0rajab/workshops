Add links of robot and the extras to the main file 
read the functions before the workshop
fix extras HTML file 
ADD md files to the workshop 
write how you generated them the workshop files

How did i make the file: 
i wrote the workshop based on the EJS syntax
created the file, then tried to solve the problems that occured 
which lead me to have to add the CSS/JS files to the index
and then add the empty page to let the code mirror file works well 
at the same time i have checked the persian version of EJS for some help 
then wrote the CSS based on my needs 

for the math, i used the vscode extension to generate my HTML file and then added it manually to EJS genereted HTML file
